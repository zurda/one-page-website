## About this project 

This is project #3 for 2020. It's the first time I've chosed to do some maintanence on an existing project rather than start a new one. Initially it felt like cheating, but starting a new project is always more fun - so honestly, this was harder than you think. Reading my past self's code was really weird.

The project was created using `semantic HTML`, `css`, and `css grid`. I also used `gh-pages`, and Github Actions.

The main goal of this project was fiddling around with lighthouse audit:

and Lighthouse audit actions on every PR:

### Things I've learned 

- Adding lighthouse audits is really nice (there's really no reason for a simple website not to pass these audits, but it's still a good reminder if we accidentally miss something)
- Worth looking into how to run these lighthouse actions **after** a deploy. Otherwise we'll only find out about problems on the next PR. 
- Past me really liked `ID`s. Not sure why. Dear future me: please fix this! ðŸ¥º
- The page was set to deploy on every `gh-pages` branch update rather than master

### Still to do

- Swap out `ID`s with `Class`es
- Find a better way to display CV 
- Looking into lighthouse actions after deploying
